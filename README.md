🏈 NFL Probability Engine
Probabilistic modeling of NFL regular season games using ELO-based structural ratings, rolling performance features, and Monte Carlo simulation for financial backtesting.

📌 Project Overview
This project builds a dynamic probabilistic framework to:
* Estimate win probabilities for NFL games
* Model expected points per team
* Simulate full game score distributions
* Backtest betting strategies using historical market lines
* The system combines structural rating models (ELO), feature engineering, machine learning classifiers, and financial simulation.
* Target application: Forecast the 2026 NFL regular season and evaluate value betting strategies under a rigorous backtesting framework.
